      "albumBio": "Manah Kalah is a jazz-rap driven, deeply personal album centered around family, generational tension, and emotional growth. The narrative follows a child’s evolving perception of family — beginning with internalized pressure and quiet resentment, and gradually shifting toward empathy and appreciation. The emotional turning point arrives at 'I Promise, I'm Alive.' The project highlights the subtle divide present in many Indian households: children often hesitate to share their struggles, while parents silently worry without expressing it. Rather than portraying dramatic rebellion or oppression, the album explores invisible expectations and unspoken fears. Through shifting tone, perspective, and instrumentation, the record builds an empathy bridge between generations — showing that misunderstanding often stems not from malice, but from love expressed imperfectly.",
